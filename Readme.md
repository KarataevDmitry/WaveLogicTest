You should implement an application that:
- Downloads historical market daily data (date, open, close, high, low) from yahoo finance (or any other free/trial marked data service you like) for selected stocks, to a selected depth.
- Aggregates daily data with selected step (for example to weekly instead of daily)
- Export/save aggregated data to pdf document to the selected folder.
- An application should be implemented with .Net 5 and C#
- An application should contain UI to choose stocks which history it should download, select history depth and aggregation step/option, and select folder to save/export result.
- You can implement UI any way you like such as Windows Forms, WPF or ASP.Net page.
- An application should be ready to compile and run without any additional settings for solution or application from our side.
